            We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your
            wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as
            possible. If you think of the sections in your project description
            as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise,
            accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project
            Description should include more information than your project
            abstract.

          <p>
            iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the
            course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your
            wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about
            your project and what works inspired you.
